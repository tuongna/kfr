PREFACE

Korean From Zero! is a Korean language book series built on Korean grammar that makes
sense! Each book is crafted page by page and lesson by lesson to have relevant (and
sometimes fun) Korean conversation and sentence structure patterns that enhance the Korean
learner’s ability to speak Korean faster and understand the small nuances of Hangul and
everyday Korean speech.

DEDICATION

This book is dedicated and made for:

Korean culture lovers, Korean language learners, Korean drama watchers,

Korean beginners, KPOP music fans, people of Korean heritage connecting to their history,
and anyone planning travel to Korea!

This began as a project for myself (George). This is the book I wanted when I started learning
Korean, but it’s also for anyone like me who loves Korea and the Korean language and want to
have a closer connection to Korea itself.

All of us on the Korean From Zero! team wish you success on your road to Korean fluency.

□ Welcome to KOREAN FROM ZERO!

LEARNING KOREAN can be intimidating at first, but don't worry! Our method is designed
to guide you step-by-step through the basics of Korean grammar. You will be surprised how
much easier a language is if you learn the basics. This book is dedicated to hammering the
basics into your head.

Whether you're learning Korean for business, travel, or to make new friends, we've created
these lessons to make sure you feel confident in your ability to SPEAK, READ, and WRITE
what you've learned.

□ Korean characters

WHAT ARE THESE CIRCLES, LINES, AND SQUARES? The Korean language uses a set
of symbols called Hangul (£j"s, pronounced hangool), to spell all words in the Korean
language. In the past, hanja, Chinese characters, were heavily used in Korea, but in
modern Korea you can get by without ever learning very much - if any - hanja. In the first
book, we will give you a crash course in Hangul. It is said that Hangul can be learned in a
day but takes years to master. Throughout the lessons we will reinforce what is taught in
the Hangul lessons and teach you exceptions to the rules, such as specific sound changes,
as needed. NOTE: Hangul is sometimes spelled “hangeul” because it matches western
spelling expectation, however the official Korean Romanization is “Hangul".

□ Korean punctuation facts

HERE ARE SOME QUICK FACTS about Korean writing to help you get started.
UPPERCASE/LOWERCASE

In English, we learn to write both A and a, but in Korean there are no upper and lower
cases. In other words, Of- js always 0|- no matter where you find it in a sentence.

SENTENCE ENDING PUNCTUATION

Written Korean uses question marks, exclamation points, commas, and periods just like
English. You will see their usage throughout the book.

KoreanFromZero.com 8

□ Before grammar...

Lessons A-G are dedicated to Hangul characters. After that a few lessons are dedicated to
teaching numbers, key phrases, and how to introduce yourself. It’s VERY important that
you don’t stress over the phrases and numbers lessons. Those sections are just for easy
access to some things you will need before you know how to make your own sentences.
The real power comes in knowing how the patterns work. Patterns will set your mind free of
mindlessly memorizing phrases.

The best thing you can do, for your Korean, is learn how to read Korean well.

This is not a choice. You MUST learn Hangul. Once you know how to read, you will learn
many key Korean grammar concepts that will set you firmly on the path to fluency.

Already know how to read Hangul?

Skip this section and move to Lesson 1 on page 53!

Korean From Zero! - Lesson A- Creating Simple Hangul

11

Hangul is the main writing system of Korea. It’s famous for being easy to learn and in many
linguistic circles is considered genius. Prior to its invention in the 15th century, Korean used
the same Chinese characters as China and Japan. Japanese and Chinese children spend a
significant part of the school years devoted to learning the often complicated Chinese
characters, but hangul can be learned in a few days for an average adult.

Hanja

Over 5000 characters for Chinese and
2000 for Japanese are used commonly.

Korean Hangul

Just 24 unique symbols combine to
make 12,000+ Hangul combinations.

If you aren’t convinced yet as to how cool hangul is, here are the top five reasons you should
learn hangul:

1. It’s easy. WAY easier than you imagine!

Some people say you can learn it in just two hours.

2. It’s cool. Seriously... none of your friends can write it!

Unless your friends are all studying Korean or ARE Korean you will be the coolest
person around when you say, and show them, that you can read and write Korean!

3. Your accent improves.

You have spent much of your life reading Roman letters (ABC) in a certain way. If you
learn Korean with those letters you will often still read them the same way and not have
a great Korean accent. If you learn hangul, you won’t have to fight your English
speaking habits!

KoreanFromZero.com 12

4. Korean Romanization can be a bit confusing. It’s just easier to learn hangul.

With combinations like “SEO” and “SAE” and “SEU” it’s pretty easy to screw up the
Romanization of Korean. Hangul fixes this problem. Besides... imagine if a Korean
person decided to learn English only using hangul characters!

5. There is no choice!

Because hangul is so easy, It’s rare that a book teaching Korean teaches using Roman
letters. Even this book teaches 100% in hangul after the hangul lesson section.

Hangul Consonants and Vowels

Hangul characters are “built” using consonant and vowel parts. Using these individual parts
over 12,000 characters can be constructed.

Don’t worry about memorizing the chart on this page, it is mainly to be used as a reference.
The next few lessons will gradually teach you how to read and write hangul. You will be
pleasantly surprised as to how easily you learn it.

In the “Korean From Zero!” series, hangul is taught using the most common input interface in
the modern world, the keyboard. In the last writing lesson you will learn the basics of typing in
Korean. NOTE: It’s helpful if you know what each of the symbols are called in Korean. Check
the “Hangul Character Name Chart” in the back of this book.

In this lesson we will focus on the first five consonants and five vowels only to get used to
creating the characters. Writing with the correct stroke order will make your writing neater.

Hangul Points

□ A-1. Using consonants and vowels to create simple hangul

When creating a hangul character you will always start with a consonant, and then follow it
with a vowel. Let’s look at some simple consonant + vowel combinations:

b + l- = 7 l

V

KoreanFromZero.com 14

□ A-2. Writing order and orientation

There are standing (vertical) and laying (horizontal) vowels. Standing vowels always
“stand” to the right of the consonant. Laying vowels always “lay” below the consonant.

C = consonant V = vowel

left / right combinations

~)\ 7H U m C|- P| Et EH D\ OH

top / bottom combinations

go gu no nu do du ro ru mo mu

□ A-3. The different sounds of ~i, s

can be pronounced like a G or a K. Typically at the beginning of a sentence or word you
will hear "i like a K, and if it is in the middle of a word it’s closer to a G.

koguma

(sweet potato)

2 can be pronounced like an R or an L. Typically at the beginning of a sentence you will
hear 2 like a R and in the middle more like L.

aJiwi rebel

"'ll ^3 (level)

As you learn Korean you will find that, depending on the word, the sound of ~i and 2 will
shift. In many cases you just have to learn how that particular word is pronounced.

Korean From Zero! - Lesson A- Creating Simple Hangul

15

□ A-4. The sound difference between -\ and

The sound for ] doesn’t really exist in English so it might be hard to master. It is certainly
one of the sounds that Korean people will ALWAYS correct you on. One technique to
getting closer to the right sound is this trick:

1. Shape your mouth as if you are going to say “AH”

2. Now say the sound “OH”. It should feel as if the sound is coming from the back of your
   throat.

Writing Practice

With the first five consonants and vowels it’s possible to create 25 different hangul characters.
To practice correct stroke order, first trace the light gray characters, then write each character
six times. We will practice with 11 of the possible 25 characters.

Hangul Points

□ B-1. Creating pure vowels with o

In this lesson we introduce the hangul character o . In order to say a pure vowel, meaning
a vowel all by itself, you must use o in the consonant spot. Here are some examples:

°l" (a) 0| (i) 2. (o) OH (ae)

KoreanFromZero.com 20

You MUST start a pure vowel hangul with o . In other words, you can never have a vowel
by itself. When o is the first character then it is silent and makes no sound. Notice how the
orientation of the o changes depending on the vowel it’s used with. The shape of the
o doesn’t have to change, but many Korean fonts change the shape for balance reasons.

The first 2 examples are
both side-by-side because
the vowel is vertical.

If the vowel is horizontal,
so is the consonant, like
these 2 examples.

Here are some example words using the hangul you have already learned. See if you can
read them.

□ B-2. Written versions versus font versions of hangul

When you first learn hangul you might be confused as to how some characters change
when written versus when typed. Let’s look at how ^ and \* change when written.

□ B-3. The different sounds of

normally sounds like an “S” sound, however when combined with certain hangul it will
sound like an “SH” sound. We cover this rule in Lesson G in more depth.

NOTE: When -u- (yo) and it (yu) are combined the “y” is discarded in the Romanization.

the next lesson. j

□ B-4. The difference between H and -||

In modern Korea, there is no sound difference between H and -||. Some words will use
one or the other based on the roots of the word. You simply just need to learn how to “spell”
some words in Korean, just like in English.

KoreanFromZero.com 22

□ B-5. The difference between t and —

To the untrained ear these will both sound the same. But the mouth makes a different
shape for t and —.

T is said with the lips pushed out like you’re trying to kiss someone and saying “oo” as in
“moon”.

— is said by pulling the lips back almost as far as you can and saying the same “oo” sound.

Writing Practice

With just the new consonants and vowels it’s possible to create another 25 different hangul
characters. To practice correct stroke order, first trace the light gray characters, then write
each character six times.

□ C-3. Hard and soft sounds with hangul

If you are like me, you may be a bit frustrated with how td, c, ^, and "i seem to shift
sounds in Korean. Koreans also have a hard time explaining the exact timing of the shift of
these sounds, td js a “B” sound, but there are cases where it also sounds like a “P”. >= is
“D”, but in some cases it will be “T”. x. is “J” but sometimes it’s “CH”. And finally, n is “G”,
but in some cases it will sound like “K”.

You will find that in the beginning of a word td, i=, x, and n will tend to be the “stronger”
sounds like P, T, CH, and K. But they will be softer in the middle and end of words.

n (P), e (j), \* (CH), =i (K) on the other hand are ALWAYS the hard sounds.

Hangul Points
□ D-1. Double vowels

Double vowels are made by writing, or typing two of the vowels you have already learned
together. They are written and input from the left vowel to right. Just like the single vowels
when they are used alone they still require the “null” character.

o

KoreanFromZero.com 34

□ D-2. °\ vs £| sound differences

These two double vowel types are commonly used in Korean. Despite looking similar in
style, 2.| is pronounced like the English word “WAY” and °| is pronounced like the English
word “WE”. Perhaps this guy below will help you remember which is which.

# %

□ D-3. The double vowels

-41 ,-l|, and t-II, despite having different parts, all sound like the “WE” in “wet”. When said
slowly by your Korean friends they might sound out the first part of the double vowel, but in
spoken Korean you might not hear the sound difference.

□ D-4. t| and —I sound differences

tI and —I might be tricky to pronounce since they are so close in sound. The sound
change of these characters is similar to the sound change for t and —. For each sound,
start with the “oo” part of “moon”, then transition into the “ee” (like clean). The only
difference is the shape of your mouth when you say the “oo” part.

□ D-5. Double consonant sounds versus other sounds

h (b / p), \* (j / ch), (d /1), “i (g / k) have a “hard” and “soft” sound. The double
consonants hh , xx, cc, n , and aa are sounded out with more energy than single consonants.
You push air into your mouth that is held back, you PAUSE slightly to let the pressure build.
Then you release to make the sound. Try not to spit on anyone.

Korean From Zero! - Lesson E - Final Consonants

39

There will be no new hangul vowels or consonants taught in this lesson, because you have
learned all of them!

This lesson introduces the most important concept when learning hangul. Understanding the
ideas taught in this lesson will allow you to conjugate verbs, adjectives and create even basic
sentence structure.

Hangul Points

□ E-1. Hangul with a “final consonant”

So far all of the hangul characters in prior lessons have ended with a vowel and only had
two parts. Now we will add consonants to the bottom of the character. These “final”
consonants are called c h £! (batchim).

3 - This shows the first consonant with a vertical vowel and double final consonant.

4 - This shows the first consonant with a horizontal vowel and double final consonant.

KoreanFromZero.com

40

Now let’s look at some actual complete hangul that have final consonants.

The following hangul characters are all built using the same initial consonant and vowel
combination. The final consonant, (batchim), is the only thing that is different.

The black portion is the c h 1=! (batchim).

Here are some words that contain hangul containing final consonant.

Example Words

tty- (Korea)

y (book)

y (eye, snow)

(hand)

XI iX (wallet)

yA| (taxi)

yxt (potato)

td F

(foot)

yxf (man)

(friend)

A|-y (person)

(money)

□ E-2. Answers to common questions

1. A vowel is never called batchim. There is no batchim if the character ends with a vowel.

2. titj xx cc ni xx can be in the final position as a final consonant, but they aren’t considered
   “double final consonants”.

Korean From Zero! - Lesson E - Final Consonants

41

Example Words (with double batchim)

usQ (to be many) e-i = tj| (chicken ribs)

euQ (to be wide) 2-\Q (to read)

Example Words (with uu,7x,cc,m,M)

tH-HTO (to be busy) JIQQ (to be close)

TO (to be salty) P (rice cakes)

PQ- (to wipe) 9XQ (to have)

□ E-3. Double vowels

Some words have “double vowels”.

Example Words (with double vowels)

AI-HI- (apple) tH (ear)

PDI (meaning) °\X\ (position)

□ E-4. The “ng” sound when o is the final consonant

When o is used as the final consonant, then it is no longer silent and instead makes an
“ng” sound.

KoreanFromZero.com 42

The following words will contain a standalone vowel and / or a sound with o as the
batchim.

Example Words

(goodbye)
01OPI (a story)
(umbrella)
(room)

(a joke)
t§§l (animal)

OhOI (child)

01 ^ (reason)

H (etc)

Q.J[ (yoga)
(pollution)
iilt (airport)

Ready for more fun? Here are words that have 2 o in some of their characters. The first o
allows the vowel to stand alone without a consontant, and the second o is the “ng” sound
as the batchim.

Example Words

Hi=[ (emergency)

(United Kingdom)
(socks)

H (dragon)

HgfOl (cat)
S§0| (buttocks)
HS» h O| (babbling)
(cherry)

Korean From Zero! - Lesson F - Typing Hangul 43

In your life, you will probably type Korean a lot more than you will write it. Of course, when you
are learning Korean, you will write it a lot, but when you are talking to your friends using chat
programs on your phone or computer, you will be typing.

In order to type Korean on your computer you will need to first make sure you have installed
the proper programs. You can go here for a tutorial on how to install Korean on your device.

http://www.KoreanFromZero.com/install-korean

(it’s 100% free)

You can also purchase stickers for just a few dollars to place hangul on your own keyboard.
Search Amazon.com or your favorite online store to see what is available.

Hangul Typing Points

□ F-1. Typing your first and second characters

The Korean keyboard is designed to make it easy to type Korean. All the consonants
(black) are on the left, and all the vowels (white) on are the right.

In order to make one character, we need at least two keystrokes. Even the most basic and
the most complicated Korean character will start with a consonant (black key) followed by a
vowel (white key). You can cut out the keyboard in the back of the book for easy reference.

As you type, the character will “build” on the screen. It might be confusing at first, but just
keep typing. You do not have to “finish” a character. The keyboard input software knows
when to end your character as long as you have correctly typed it.

1 >

In Korean mode you will type
each character part by
tapping each character.

g g + k

Until your character is
“complete” the underline will
show the current status.

< >

You have to keep typing so
the input system knows how to
complete the first character.

As you are typing, sometimes the 3rd key stroke gets added to the bottom of the first
character, EVEN though you want this to be the 1st stroke of the 2nd character. DO NOT
PANIC! Once you type the next vowel the 2nd character will be created. This is because
NO Korean character can have a CVCV combination. Once the software sees CVCV it
knows to make two characters. If it doesn’t type what you want it to... YOU have made a
mistake. You can always use backspace to erase just the last input.

□ F-2. Shift characters

The “double consonants” require the shift key to be pressed first. Or, in the case of “double
vowels”, two vowels in a row will be required to complete the vowel.

Double Key Examples

shift + c = cc

shift + tz = xx

-   I- = 4

T + H = T-|

Example Word

EE (again, once more)
Af-nf- (salty)
sih2.il (Tuesday)
il-Q.il (Monday)

□ F-3. Shortcuts and the spacebar (Windows)

On a Windows PC, you can cycle installed language input methods by pressing “ALT” key
and ~ (top left key) at the same time. When in Korean mode you can toggle to English input
by hitting the RIGHT “ALT” key. The left one does NOT toggle. When you hit the space bar,
the character you are working on will immediately complete and a space will be added.

□ F-4. Hangul typing exercise

If you don’t have stickers or a Korean keyboard, you can print a copy of the keyboard from
the back of this book.

Now you should practice typing Korean. Here are some practice words along with the
actual keys pressed to make them display. As you type each key, watch how the
characters build on the screen.

The letters on top of each example are what you ACTUALLY type on your keyboard when
you are in Korean mode.

Korean From Zero! - Lesson G - Sound Change Rules

47

When certain hangul are combined, their sounds can change in unexpected ways. In the
beginning, knowing these sound changes might not be as beneficial. However, you will
eventually learn some words with spellings that might confuse you as to their pronunciation.

You should look at this section from time to time to see if there are any new words you have
learned that have a unique sound change. We are only listing some of the common changes.

□ G-1. T-stops

When certain characters are used as a they are converted to “T” sound. The “T Stop”
characters are \*, ■= and e are also T sounds but since they are normally T

sounding they are left out of the examples.

When there are two s back to back the sound is always “L”. When s j s at the end of a
word it’s always an “L” sound. When s is at the beginning of a word it’s an “R” sound.

□ G-5. s(E|#)and ■- ( L l£) combinations

When a 2 is followed by a l OR the l\_ is followed by s the combined sound changes to

When you are learning Korean, and you have a friend or teacher helping you they
might actually say o|-llf- as “HADA” because they are saying it slow.

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 1 - 20 Starter Phrases

53

Lesson 1:

20 Starter Phrases

Before This Lesson

1. Make sure you know, or have an understanding of,
   how to read hangul. From this point on there will
   be no Roman letters.

Lesson Goals

1. Learn some of the basic phrases that you will need
   right away when speaking Korean.

From The Teachers

1. Don’t worry too much about the grammar behind
   any of the phrases. As you learn more, the
   grammar in these phrases will start to make
   sense. Right now your goal should be to memorize
   and use these phrases.

2. If you can’t read the hangul just go back to the
   hangul charts and lessons to refresh your memory.

KoreanFromZero.com 54

As a language teacher, I am never happy when students focus on phrases instead of
grammar. It’s like the saying, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to
fish and you feed him for a lifetime.”

Memorizing phrases is nowhere near as effective as learning how to build your OWN
sentences. These phrases will help you communicate when your Korean still... sucks.

Communication

These phrases are handy when you begin using the Korean you have learned.

1. 223| 1T6H ?A1|2.

2. cn 2 y iron ?Alia.

Lesson 2:

Korean Numbers

Before This Lesson \_

1. Review hangul.

2. Practice writing or typing the phrases you learned
   in the last lesson.

Lesson Goals \_

1. Learn the two types of Korean counting systems.

From The Teachers \_

1. It will take some effort to learn the two counting
   systems. Don’t worry too much if you are slow to
   memorize them. The first 10 numbers of both
   systems are most important.

These systems are repeated in several lessons
throughout the book so eventually you will
memorize them.

□ 2-1. Different Korean Number Systems

Korean has two number systems. They are the “Korean numbers” and “Chinese numbers”.
Each one has its specific uses that you will learn as we progress through the lessons.

The two systems are typically never mixed, with the exception of telling time.

You must know both systems to survive in Korea. Both systems will be taught in this lesson
and reinforced in following lessons.

The Korean counting system stops at 99. Above 99 you must jump to the “Chinese system”
also called “Sino-Korean numbers”. All numbers 100 and above will be taught in section
9-11. Before you get there, let the first 99 absorb!

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 2 - Korean Numbers

61

Chinese Number System

□ 2-7. Differences between the Korean and Chinese numbers

The Chinese number system is completely unique from the Korean system. The Korean
system stops at 99, but with the Chinese system, numbers from 1 to 1,000,000,000 and
beyond can be made. Depending on the usage, one number system will be used over the
other. We will discuss when each system is used as we learn counters and other Korean
concepts in this book and other books in the series.

It’s important to note that even though it’s called the “Chinese” system, these numbers are
considered part of the Korean language and not part of Chinese. In other texts you may
see the Chinese numbers referred to as “Sino-Korean”. “Sino” just means “Chinese”.

We feel that calling them “Chinese” is more comfortable.

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 3 - Self Introduction / Age

65

Lesson 3:

Self Introduction /
Age

Before This Lesson

1. Learn the Korean numbers, since saying your age
   in Korean requires them.

Lesson Goals

1. Learn the key phrases to say to people you are
   meeting for the first time.

2. Learn how to say your age in Korean.

From The Teachers

1. This is the last lesson where phrases are taught in
   such quantity. After this lesson we will begin
   teaching grammar patterns. However, introducing
   yourself is a key part of speaking Korean, so the
   only option at this point is to memorize the key
   phrases.

KoreanFromZero.com 66

First Meeting

When you first meet new Koreans you will hear a variation of the first or second phrase. If you
are meeting in a more formal situation then the first phrase will be used. In more casual
situations such as language meetups, the classroom, or among friends you will most likely
hear the second sentence.

i. eh-w - ———' i=f L l F|- despite written with a “B” sound ( 1=1 ) is 1

Nice to meet you. (very polite) pronounced like i=r L |E|- with an “M” sound, (n)

Pronunciation Note

As needed we will remind you of some of the pronunciation rules.

Simple Rule

When td (B) is followed by l\_ (N) the sound always changes to □ (M).

Longer Explanation

In Korean words, when the ^ also called “the final consonant”, is td, the final sound
of the character would be a “b” sound. However, when td js immediately followed by l\_
(n sound) the sound changes to an “m” sound as if the td was actually n.

Nice to meet you. (Casual Polite)

This phrase is used when you are meeting new people in a casual situation. Perhaps a
friend introduced you to their friends, or you are at one of the many language meetups
around Korea. NOTE: If you want a quick way to make Korean friends in Korea, you
should travel to a language meetup. Many major cities throughout the world have
meetups. You can search for some on Meetup.com.

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 3 - Self Introduction / Age

67

Asking Names 0|# ^7|

This simple phrase also has a few variations depending on the formality of the situation.

In formal situations, such as talking to someone above you in status, (bosses, someone older
than you, teachers) the first two can be used, but in more casual situations the third one is fine.

3. -aitoi <H® 7 || EPIlfl?

What is your name? (formal)

4. -SsfOl 0^711 £|tJL|77p

What is your name? (formal)

5. 0|#0| \*|0||fi?

What is your name? (when talking to equals or people below you)

How to answer

When answering, there are a few ways to do it.

The reality is that, since you are not Korean, any way will be fine. Koreans will be tougher on
native Koreans in regard to formality than a foreigner learning the language. So if you get this
wrong, you will not be summarily killed. Even Koreans will answer a formal question with a
more casual / polite response depending on the situation.

Typically, you are safe to match formal to formal and casual to casual. But if the person is
older than you, your response should show them the respect they “deserve” as an elder, even
if they ask in a casual manner.

6. \_L| <T.

I am\_.

This is very standard, yet formal and polite. Nothing bad can happen if you are polite.

7. \_(0|) ELa in it.

I am called\_.

This is used if your name and what you are called are different. If you are “Joseph” but
everyone calls you “Joe” this is the phrase you use. If the Korean version of
your name ends with a c h □ then use the 0| in the parenthesis.

8. \*1| 0|#£_ojL|CK

My name is\_.

This is the polite way to tell someone your name if you haven’t been asked.

KoreanFromZero.com 68

Asking Age L| , 0| s?|

How old are you?

This literally means “What does your age become?” and is polite.

10. % 4 h 0|0]|fi?

(sounds like >4 s h )

How old are you?

This is polite, but is much closer to casual than formal. It can be asked to children.

11. \_2! L| C[.

□ 3-1. Korean age VS International age

In Korea you might be surprised that even a baby can be born and in one month be 2 years
old. Koreans use the Chinese New Year to count their age. So everyone in Korean age is
always 1-2 years older than their international age. It all depends on when they were born.

So when you ask a Korean person who hasn’t travelled abroad their age, they will most

During your studies you will soon realize that grammar points aren’t so easily forgotten.
But you need more than grammar to speak effectively - you need a lot of vocabulary too!

Throughout this book we will introduce groups of words that are important for everyday Korean
speaking. You don’t have to try to memorize them all at once. Just familiarize yourself with
each group since they will be showing up in subsequent lessons.

Korean Culture tEs\

Korean names are often just three characters long. The last name is one character, and the
first name is two characters. The family name, (last name) is actually said first. M| follows the
name, to mean “Mr.”, “Mrs.”, etc. There is always a space before the M|.

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 4 - Creating Simple Sentences

73

Grammar

0 4-1. Creating simple sentences with 0\L[

0|E|-, depending on the context, can mean: “it is”, “this is”, “they are”, “these are”, “I am”,
“you are”, “he is”, “she is”, and “we are”. It’s always placed at the end of a sentence.

As discussed in prior lessons we know that Korean has several levels of politeness. Let’s
look at how to conjugate 0| cf- into a few forms\_

The most polite form of 0| Ef- js: \_| Whenever td is the c: □ followed by l

oj L| (pronounced like S M '- the h sound changes to □

r >

[noun] tj L l E\. (no space after the noun)

It’s a [noun].

^ Example sentences

A

1.

It’s a book.

2. ?!!^l|ck

It’s a pen.

3. A^°jL|CK

It’s an apple.

4. tx^o|ojl|lk

It’s a cat.

J

Among friends it’s more common to change tJ L l to 0| Oj|fi. which is the 3. form
conjugation of tJ L l The form is still considered polite, so if you accidentally use it with
someone you don’t know it isn’t a problem.

Example sentences

1. \*!|0|Oj|a.

2. ^0|Oj|a.

It’s a book.
It’s a pen.

Notice that the sentences above each have objects where the final sound is a consonant.

In this case you will always use 0|Oj|fi.. However, if the final sound is a vowel, 0|Oj|fi. can’t
be used. Instead, you MUST use

NOTE:

Example sentences

1. \*\ 0 \\ 3 .

2 . 3 . 0 \\ 9 ..

3. Hm\3.

4. TLcfOl Oj|fi..

0| in n?f0| is
part of the word.
0\\3 is used since
0| has no cf □.

It’s a car.

It’s a nose.
It’s an apple.
It’s a cat.

It doesn’t matter if the final sound is a vowel or consonant when using tJ L l
Either way you will use tJ L l

KoreanFromZero.com 74

O 4-2. Making questions with 0|c[

The way you create a question is different, depending on which version of 0| cf- you use.

If you use the -2. form (0| 0||fl.) then you simply add a question mark and make it sound like
a question.

[noun]0|0]|.Q.? (no space after the noun)
Is it a [noun]?

1. Example conversation between friends.

A: ^|0||fi?

A:

What is it?

B: ^0|0||fl.

B:

It’s a foot.

Example conversation between friends.

A: Tl&0|0]|fi?

A:

Is it a cat?

B: 0\[-\a\_. 7H0||fl.

B:

No, it’s a dog

The more polite form of 0| cf- (°J !\_| C|-) has a special question form.

(

[noun] t] i-l ^7[?

\

V

Is it a [noun]?

)

f Example conversation

1. Conversation between friends.

A: ^£JL|^?

A: What is it?

B: stJ L l

B: It’s a foot.

2. Conversation between friends.

A: H^0|°jL|7;|- ?

A: Is it a cat?

^ B: 0[L|fi. 7H°JL|CK

B: No, it’s a dog.

J

O 4-3. Remember that 0| is neutral

In English we use a lot of pronouns like “he”, “she”, etc. in our sentences. Korean also has
pronouns that will be taught in lesson 7, but pronouns are typically not expressed directly.
The context of the conversation decides if 0|Lf- means “it is”, “he is”, “she is”, etc.

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 5 - This, That, and Negatives 81

O 5-2. The topic marker tt I zr

Korean uses a variety of “markers”, also referred to as “particles”. These markers always
come after a word. The first marker we will learn is the topic marker b / b.

If the topic word ends with a ^ □ then it is followed by b and if it doesn’t then b is used.

XLJ

b is used because the character just before it
ends with a consonant. In other words,
there isa in the final character.

KoreanFromZero.com 82

In the following sentences pay attention to which version of the topic marker is used.

^ Example sentences

1. H|-L|-L|-^ n|-^0|0||fi..

2. £0|feOt\*HO||fl.

Bananas are fruit.

Cucumbers are vegetables.

2. ^ HHjO|0]|fl.

3. O^HO||fi.. ★ (read 5-4)

^ Tangerines are fruit.

i geot

°] 7 A

(this one)

O 5-4. Sound blending

When a (A]^) or other final consonants are followed by any character that begins with o
(0|-§-) the sound of that character moves to the position of the o (0|

You can imagine that the o (0|-§-) is absorbing the sound of the prior c’a.

This happens EVERY time you have a □ followed by the topic marker •&.

gyul eun gyu reun

sounds like

sa ram eun sa ra meun

^ sounds like

beo seos eun beo seo seun

sounds like

beginning a character
sounds like “S”

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 5 - This, That, and Negatives

83

★ In section 5-3 we explained that (\*121) is pronounced like a “T” when it’s at the end of
a character. However, when it is followed by o (0|-§-) jt is an “S” sound. Now go back and
re-read sentence 4 in section 5-2.

O 5-5. This, that, and that over there

The usage of 0 121 (this), J-21 (that), and \*121 (that over there) is similar to English. Since
all three of the words end with 21 you just need to remember how to pronounce them when
they are in a sentence followed by the topic marker -E-. If necessary refer to the sound
blending taught in section 5-3 and 5-4. The position of the object in relation to the speaker
and listener affects the usage.

\_\_\_ J

f Special Information^) \

When referring to an item someone is holding, or that is near them, then it doesn’t
matter how far they are from you, J-21 (that) and not 21 (that over there) must be
used.

Also, normally if you are talking to yourself, or are thinking you can freely use J-21
instead of \*121. But... since no one can hear you... it doesn’t really matter!

KoreanFromZero.com 84

O 5-6. Saying “it isn’t” with 0^L|C|- and omo)|fi.

t] L l (it is) and 0|-y L | c\ (jt isn’t) are opposite in meaning. However, when
using OhH L l ^h, the “subject marker” 0| / 7\ must be placed after the item being talked
about. We will learn more about the 0| / 7\ marker in lesson 8. For now just learn the
following rules:

1. You must have a pattern of [item] 7\ 0[^ L| cj-

2. If the item ends with a □ (final consonant) then 0| is used instead of 7\.

3. £jL|Cf- will NEVER use 0| / 7\.

Lesson 6:

Introduction to
descriptive verbs

Before This Lesson

1. Know vocabulary group: D (people) words.

Lesson Goals

1. Learn how to conjugate Korean verbs into the
   BASIC form.

2. Understand the difference between the verb
   BASIC form and STEM.

3. Learn how to specify objects using this and that.

From The Teachers

1. As teachers we found it difficult to effectively teach
   the existing 0|-/0H/0=| verb rules without confusing

the students. To solve this problem we created a
form we call the “BASIC” form. We are confident
this form will help you a great deal on your road to
Korean fluency. LEARN IT WELL!

□ 6-1. Descriptive verbs / Adjectives

Korean verbs are grouped into “action” and “descriptive” verbs. Action verbs include words
like, “to swim”, ”to eat”, and ”to go”. Descriptive verbs include words like , “cold”, “spicy”,
and “nice”. Action and descriptive verbs have slightly different usage rules, so it’s important
to know which verb type you are using. Let’s start with some descriptive verbs.

Grammar

O 6-2. Korean verb stems

In section 6-1 we introduced 11 new descriptive verbs. Each verb has two forms listed.
The cf form is what will be in the dictionary.

When you remove the cf from any verb you are left with what we will call the “stem”.
The black portion is the verb stem.

O 6-3. Korean verb BASIC form

The “BASIC” form is sometimes called the “fully conjugated stem”, “vowel contraction”, or
very commonly the “Of- / Oj / Oj form”. But, these names don’t give the form the recognition
it deserves. For this reason, we choose to call it the BASIC form.

Why is BASIC form great?

The BASIC form can be casual, polite, present tense, future tense, or even a command.
In fact, the BASIC form is a fundamental part of many Korean grammar patterns. It’s
v. one of the most important verb forms you will learn.

You will need to understand the difference between the stem, and the basic form. Many
grammar patterns will be listed as: STEM + (something), or BASIC + (something)

KoreanFromZero.com 94

O 6-4. Creating verb BASIC form

To make the BASIC form 0|- / 0] / Oj will be added to the stem using a set of rules which
are covered in the next section.

The following rules are used to create the BASIC form for most verbs.

As needed, we will introduce irregular conjugations in other lessons. From the stem and the
stem’s LAST vowel you can create the BASIC form.

"-Special Information <£>-

Some verbs have a double vowel as the last vowel in their stem. We have not defined
BASIC rules for double vowel verbs. For example when you have -l| in the stem then
you overlay ] to make -41 to make the BASIC form.

The BASIC form of £\ cf- (to become) is EH

Verbs with double vowels —I t-| tI etc. are not very common. They are too rare to

expand the rules to include them. For double vowel stems just add after them.
This example demonstrates one such verb.

The BASIC form of (to date) is CH

O 6-5. Simple sentences using descriptive verbs

One of the most common uses of the BASIC form is “present tense”.

If you use the BASIC form “as is” what you are saying will be very informal / casual, and
possibly rude Korean depending on who you are speaking with. In order to make the
BASIC form polite you add Q. form is one of the most common polite forms used.

Instead of B/h use the subject marker 0\P[ to mark the item being talked about. If the
item ends in a vowel use 7\ and if it ends with a □ use 0|.

Grammar

O 7-3. Possession words and the particle

The possession marker £| follows a word to make it possessive, or to make it a “modifier”
of the following word. All you do is add —I to the word to make it possessive.

Example sentences

1 .

My grades are good.

2. \*i°l Sl£ a^ojl|iik
   M y friend is Japanese.

3. *i°| ^*J^A-m#0|01|fi.
   My boyfriend is 30 years old.

4. L-j£| x\7[ H|M|-?-cd.

3. ^AJ£| A1AHU0 X|a]| AjAHyojL|77^? 6. Lfo|

Is your teacher Mrs. Jihye? My car is a Toyota.

NOTE: The —I hangul is pronounced like “we” with your bottom lip pulled back. HOWEVER,
in the following cases you might hear it pronounced as 0)|.

1. When it’s at the end of a word, (especially after ^

2. When it’s spoken fast.

You can also use £| after names and titles to show possession. After names it acts like (‘s)

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 7 - Pronouns and possession

111

You can combine -VM 1 with °| to say “whose”.

O 7-4. Short versions of “my” and “your”

L |-— I is often shortened to L H and *l£| shortened to *11 to mean “my” or even “me /1”.
If it’s in front of another noun then it’s “my” and if not then it is “me /1”.

Korean unfortunately does not have different sounds for Ml and L H.

So the same sound can mean “you” and “me”. To avoid this Koreans pronounce Ml as L l
when speaking. You usually won’t see L l in writing, but in speaking L l is very common.

On a funny note, if you listen to KPOP music you might have wondered why they keep
saying “NIGA”. Well they aren’t trying to be hip hop. They are actually saying “you are...”.

Is your car a Toyota?

It’s important to know that words such as A|| (my), and Ml (your) will ALWAYS be followed
by a noun. These words are modifying the noun they come before.

Ml noun = my noun
Ml noun = your noun

Ml, = yes Ml?} = you
Ml. = yes Til 7} = I

O 7-5. The word “you” and pronoun usage

Even though we just taught you how to say “you” and “your”, it’s REALLY important to
understand that Korean doesn’t use “you” and “your” as frequently as English does. It’s
almost as if they purposely avoid it. Sentences automatically determine pronouns such as,
“you”, “I”, “he” and, “she” based on the context.

For example, “you” or “your” isn’t part of “What is your name?”

This is because of the context.

°]#°1 M °fl - 2 -?

If this is said to you, you know it’s YOUR name.

However, if you are talking to a friend about his new girlfriend, the same phrase could
mean “What is HER name?”

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 7 - Pronouns and possession

113

So when do you actually say “you” in Korean?

You will hear S'lJ in Korean pop music, dramas, and translated materials. Whenever the
generic “you” is required, then o h is used. Because English often uses “you”, it’s very
common to see o h in Korean translations, however avoiding it is best.

o 1- ^ is also used by couples when addressing each other.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

You should avoid using o h lJ when talking to people as it’s a bit weird and might even be
considered rude. It’s much more common to refer to people by their names or using \-=\ in
casual speech.

O 7-6. Using 5! to say “thing”

In section 6-7 we took the first part of 0| (this one) to make 0| which can go in front of
any noun to say “this (noun)”. This is very powerful, but so is the remaining 7A which just
means “thing”. 7A is a common part of many Korean grammar patterns. It can be used to
refer to physical things, and ideas. In this lesson we use it to say “It’s mine” and “whose is
it” etc.

-\

physical and

abstract “thing”

Although 7 A can be translated as “thing”, it is often not said in the English translation,
despite it being a very important part of the grammar.

3M Special Information <£>

In English we can say “Is this yours?” to a complete stranger. In Korea there is a layer
of politeness with complete strangers. Directly referring to a person you don’t know as
YOU either using S' £1 or M is not normal. For this reason you wouldn’t ask “Is this
yours” to someone UNLESS you know them. Also, since you know them, and since M
is casual, you would use casual speech (which is covered in section 13-10)

You shouldn’t say these sentences:

1. °l L 1—I ^0|01|fi.? Is this magazine yours?

2. 0| ^X|-b^A|o| ^0|0flS? Is this magazine yours?

If you are talking to your friend you can say these casual phrase:

1. °l L 1—I 010|=? Is this magazine yours?

2. 0| L-|| ^lo|0|:? Is this magazine yours?

When talking to a stranger it’s better to ask:

1. 0| £0|0]|fl?

Whose magazine is this?

O 7-7. “He” and “She” pronouns

In English we use “he” and “she” when talking about a person whom might be with us.
However, in Korean you never say “he” or “she” about a person whom is with you.

“He” in Korean can be simply, TL or TL ZL A|-^[ can also mean “that person”, so the
context of the sentence will determine if it means “he” or not. TLL=] means “her” but it is
never said in spoken Korean. It is only used in written Korean.

Although this has been said before, it’s VERY important to understand that Korean does
NOT continually use pronouns like English. Once a topic is introduced, it is typically NOT
restated again in any form. For English speakers who are used to continually saying “he”,
“she”, “I”, “you” this might be a challenge.

Some books, including this one, will sometimes restate a topic, or use pronouns more than
necessary in order to teach certain concepts. As this book progresses we will wean you off
of overusing pronouns.

If you DO use pronouns when they don’t have to be used, don’t worry, it’s a common
mistake of new speakers of Korean. You may not sound natural, but will be understood.

□ 8-1. (a lot, many)

5$ is a very common descriptive verb used in daily Korean. This is one of the first words
in this book that has a2cn (double final consonant). The final consonant in 5$ is the “h”
sound o (o|-§-). It’s silent and the entire character should be pronounced as Eh

Example sentences

1. PMfi. (sounds like nh L h-Q-)
   There is a lot.

2. ^X]\7[ SOhfl. ^-^

(I have) a lot of homework.

3. sms. - ——

My friend has a lot of homework.

4 .

Teacher has many friends.

The “I have” isn’t actually said in Korean,
but it is implied based on context.

If you say “My sister is stressed” first, then it
translates as “She has lots of homework.”

-   f Using the topic marker you can ^

-directly specify who you are

talking about instead of relying
on context or prior sentences.

□ 8-2. 0 \ sjcf (hard), (easy), and (spicy)

These three descriptive verbs don’t follow the standard BASIC pattern. You might
eventually wonder why they are “irregular” when it seems most td descriptive verbs don’t
follow the regular pattern.

isn’t a descriptive verb but it still uses the rules from the prior lessons. The BASIC
form is needed to fully use the verb. Q- after the BASIC form makes the sentence polite.

(^\Example sentences

1. TL o= 0 p |- 5i C>1 .

Don’t let the final 0| in 0| confuse you. This is
just a part of the word and not the subject marker.

There is a cat. /1 have a cat.

2. op^oiOjfi.

There are /1 have vegetables.

3. e«o| sioja?

Do you have a pen?

There is /1 have gimbap.

5. ^$iOj£?

What is there? / What do you have?

□ 8-5. 8m (to not exist, to not have)

SJCf- has the opposite meaning of It also has ScS (double final consonant). When
saying SJDf- the a (A|is silent unless it’s followed by a vowel. When it’s in the BASIC
form then both the u (H|-g-) and a (A|^-) are sounded out much like the “obs” in the
word “obscure”. However, by no means is 2JDf- obscure in the Korean language. You will
certainly use it every day you speak Korean.

Example sentences

1. TL&0|7f- StOjfi.

There isn’t a cat. /1 don’t have a cat.

2. 0P|7^Ojfi.

There aren’t any /1 don’t have vegetables.

3.

I don’t have a younger sister.

5. E«0| gJOj a.?

6. n 7[^0\

Grammar ^ «

O 8-6. Location marker Oil

The location marker Oj| is the Korean version of “in, on, at”. You put it after a location to
mark it as the location where something is or isn’t. We will use the new words Op| (here)
etc. that were introduced in this lesson.

KoreanFromZero.com 130

^ Example sentences

1. op|0j| 91 o \ r .

It’s here.

3. c>jqoj| °[oja?

Where is it?

\

2. 2-j71Oj| SlOjfl.

It isn’t there.

4. \*j7|0j| $iOja.

It’s over there.

)

Now let’s make bigger sentences that have subjects and locations.

^ Example sentences

1. X[7[O\7\0\\

A car is here.

3. 31 cfOl 7f- Oj C| Oj| °iOja?

Location words are used with objects to say things like “in front of the car” and “on top of
the table”. Simply add the location word after the item followed by the location marker Oj|.

^Example sentences

See if you can cover the English of the following sentences and guess the English
based on the pictures in the prior section.

1. \*H&?|0j| Tl&0|7f°l0ja.

2.

\*HM«oj|^o| oioj«a.

3.

3. \*H&^0j| mi^0| oioja.

4.

XHAh c|Oj| 7|BjO| Oja.

^ There is a penguin in the desk.

There is a giraffe behind my desk.

All of the prior sentences had a pattern of “There is an animal on top of the desk.” with the
topic of the sentence being the location. However, if we want to make the animal the
primary topic, we would change the sentences to the ones below.

Example sentences

1. °|0j| oiQja.

The cat is on top of the desk.

Oil 9MO-.

The mouse is under the desk.

3. 4^011 °iOja.

6. ^|0|| °iOja.

What just happened?

What is different between the first and second set of sentences? 0| / 7|- subject markers
have changed to £■ / -b topic markers. Furthermore, the order of the sentences are
different since a topic should start the sentence. The English also completely changes.

Further down the rabbit hole...

So why isn’t a b / b topic marker used after the location in the first set of sentences? You
actually CAN say 0j|b. The b isn’t needed unless you wish to stress the specific location.

s|&?lo||-b iSJophgojfl.

□ 9-1. Ways to say “very” in Korean

There are multiple ways to say “very” in Korean. Here are some of the most common ways.
No matter what anyone tells you... all of these words are used to mean “very”. It’s pure
semantics to say one is a “different” version of “very”.

very (quite—)

very (really—)

very (really—)

When M-m- is used in a sentence where the verb is perceived as “negative” then, in most
cases, it means “too”. When used in a positive sentence it means “very”.

Example sentences

□ 9-2. HH|-.2 c|- (fast), ^ irregular verb types

-eL irregulars still follow the BASIC form rules taught in section 6-4. They are irregular
because the s (E|-§-) sound is doubled by adding a s to the bottom of the first character.
Most verbs that have eL in them are this type.

The eL changes based on the BASIC form rules (section 6-4) rule #5. Then a s is added to
the first character of the stem. The bottom 2 examples are verbs you don’t know yet.

When the LAST character in the stem has —, BASIC rule #5 is used, and it’s changed
to h or H based on the PRIOR character’s vowel. It’s easy to mistakenly use the
FIRST character for the vowel change with longer words. For example:

O 9-6. Saying “and” in lists

2f- and H(- are used to connect nouns in a list. If the item just before “and” has a then
is used, and if there isn’t a c h □ then £[■ is used. This “and” is only ever used to connect
nouns and NEVER sentences. The 2f- or Hf- has no space before, and always one after.

Example sentences

1.

Give me gimbap and soup.

2. SltoiOjfi.

Bananas and tangerines are tasty.

Korean and Japanese are really hard.

4. X\2k

A tea and a coffee please.

5. :a&o|^&o^|7^|oj°|a.

Cats and puppies are cute.

6. X1| OjQjL|^O^T|^ Lj°

My mother and father are really kind.

In English, a comma is used for word lists, then “and” is used on the last word: (cats, dogs,
and pigs). For Korean, £[■ or is required between every word in the list.

Example sentences

1.

Give me gimbap, soup, and a banana.

2. ^L|-o| DjE|^ <\*-§f0| 0^ OpttjR.- —-

Your older sister’s hair and face are very pretty.

3. i#0| I0|R. t-~ —

Bananas, tangerines, and melons are tasty.

nj£| means “head”, but is also
used to say “hair”.

Each item in the “and” changes
whether £[• or is used.

O 9-7. Korean Counters

In English we have “slices of pizza”, “cups of coffee”, “reams of paper”, “schools offish”, “packs
of wolves”, and “wads of cash”. Just like English, Korean will count things in unique ways based
on what is being counted.

The first counter is the 7f| counter. 7f| is the generic counter used for everyday items. 7|j counter
is sometimes used even when a more appropriate counter exists. It is never used for people,
animals, machines, cars etc. as these types of items already have well defined counters.

If you are ever at a loss as to which counter to use, use this one. You might be wrong, but at
least you will have said a counter in the spot where one is needed.

KoreanFromZero.com 148

generic counter JH

You will notice that there are slight changes to the numbers 1,2,3,4 and 20 when adding
the counter. These changes occur in ALL counters using native Korean numbers. From 1-
99, Korean numbers are used, but for 100 and up Chinese numbers are used.

Examples

n (20) ott n ( 90 ) mb n (30) n (so)

^¥7H(22) ^^^7H(17) Ol-^cl-^ 7H (45) 7H (61)

O 9-8. How to say a certain number of something

To say things like “4 apples” and “2 pens” you simply put the number + counter word
directly after the item.

O 9-12. Using money counters

Money is always counted using Chinese numbers. To use the money counters such as £!
(Won), (Yen), and if(Dollars) you just add the counter word for the money after the
number. There is always a space before the money counter.

Grammar irH

In this lesson we introduce “action” verbs. Up until now we have learned mostly “descriptive”
verbs. The good news is that the conjugation methods, such as BASIC form, taught in section
6-4 work for both types.

010-1. Past tense

Up until this point, we have only used the present tense of verbs to say things like “There
are 2 cats” and “It is cold”. If we want to say “There WERE 2 cats” and “It WAS cold” we
need to create the past tense form of the verbs.

To make verbs past tense you add aa to the bottom of the BASIC form then add .

O 10-3. BASIC future tense and present tense

Depending on the context of the sentence BASIC form can be future and present tense.
You can force context by adding appropriate time words such as L H SI (tomorrow),

°H s (every day), and ^1^- (now). Pay attention to how by changing just ONE word the
tense of the sentence changes.

In spoken Korean using the BASIC form is very common.

-Special Information^!)-

BASIC form can only be future and present tense. The BASIC form is NEVER past
tense. To make past tense you must use the pattern taught in section 10-1. Also,
without the proper context BASIC form defaults to present tense.

KoreanFromZero.com 170

O 10-4. Future tense (will do, going to do)

Another way to make future tense verbs is 2 /H 7-j0||fi. form. This form has benefits over
the BASIC future tense since it doesn’t require context to make it future tense. s/-§- 7-j0j|fi.
for regular, and also j=L irregular verbs, is made using the pattern below.

Example sentences

1. ee I will go to Seoul.

2. §r m\Q-. My friend is coming on Wednesday.

3. L H s There will be many people tomorrow.

4. I will be at home today.

While it’s true that s/# 7j Oj|S. means, “I will-”, or “I am going to-”, it is also used to
assume probable future outcomes. For example with any descriptive verb, it is more natural
to translate s/-§ 7-j0j|fi. to “It will probably be~” or “It might be~”, instead of, “It will be~”.

KoreanFromZero.com 172

-(D^s§S Special Information <£>-

SUMMARY: To verb “to rain” or “to snow” uses the verb i2Xt (to come).

When tdI (rain) and 2 (snow) fall, Koreans say “it’s coming” using (to come).

Example sentences

1.

L-HSI td| 7\ ^ 7]0\\a..

It will rain tomorrow.

2.

\*l^^0| 9.\R.

It’s snowing now.

3.

It rained on Tuesday.

4.

01\*11 20| %o\a\_.

It snowed yesterday.

O 10-7. A note about the time marker Oil

The time marker Oil translates to “in”, “on”, or “at” in relation to times.

You should not use time marker 0]| with -2-iir (today), 01\*11 (yesterday), and L H s
(tomorrow). You should use 01| after named times like “Sunday”, “March”, or “3pm”.
NOTE: 01| is often dropped in spoken Korean.

Example sentences

1. LHSjof^oip^.

2 . iifiSjOII

3. 01*11 *1^2 017|01| OIOH 01 fl.

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 11 - Dates and Time

183

Lesson 11:

Dates and Time

Before This Lesson\_

1. Learn vocabulary groups: J (things around the
   house) and K (events).

2. Review the future and past tense verb
   conjugations.

Lesson Goals

1. Learn four new action verbs.

2. Learn how to tell time and make dates.

From The Teachers

1. This is a numbers heavy lesson since both
   Chinese and Korean numbers are used to tell
   time. Make sure you are strong with the numbers.

2. As you learn more action verbs you will BE ABLE
   to say more everyday actions. One great way to
   practice your Korean is to say as many things you
   can in Korean as you do them. For example, “I will
   go to the store.” etc. Sure... you will look crazy if
   anyone sees you, but your Korean will improve the
   more you ACTUALLY speak it.

)

There are three ways to say “with” someone.

1.

You can use the £[■ / that you already learned in section 9-4. If the person you are
doing something with has a ^ then use Hf- and if not use 2|\

' ^si\- 3WJL. ’

I went with a friend.

KoreanFromZero.com 186

2 . o[JL

You can also use o(-H. o(-H never changes regardless of if there is or isn’t a □.

3. ^/0|Bh

If the person you are doing something with has a c" □ use 0| o h and if not use o h .

Use the “with” words to say you did something with someone. Adding Ie °l is not required,
but it strengthens the sentence.

2|- / are typically used in written Korean, and in more formal situations like news reports
or talking to your boss.

o h / °l o and ol-H are used in more casual / spoken situations. You can always use °|-T1
if you don’t want to worry about ^ □ usage.

011-11. The event location marker Oj|A-j (and from)

When you are saying that you DID something SOMEWHERE then you cannot use the
location marker 0||. Instead you must use the “event location” marker Oj|Aj (in, at, on).

1 bought a desk in America.

is used to express that something was done ahead of time, s Aj is a much stronger word,
used when the speaker is surprised that the thing was done. Despite these slightly different
nuances of the words, many people interchange them freely regardless of the situation.

011-13. How to say years and complete dates in Korean

To say years you will just say the full number, such as 2015 or 1998, then add the word ^
(year). Korean doesn’t break up the year into two parts like we do in English. For example,
they don’t say 19-80 (nineteen - eighty).

f Example sentences

1. 0|AjAj^L4

You already know months, so let’s look at days of the month. You will just say the Chinese
numbers plus the word for “day” which is s.

the days of the month (Ss)

Complete dates in Korean always in the order of year, month, day of the month. Remember
that the order is always from the largest time span to the smallest.

From this point, we will write numbers as they are normally written in Korea, which is,

tedious to keep typing out the numbers!

It’s handy to know Ef| Oj Lf-cf- (to be born) in Korean for the next set of examples. Since you
know how to conjugate verbs, you already know how to ask when someone was born.

O 12-11. Directly modifying with »=\* irregular descriptive verbs

h irregular, since they are irregular, are converted a bit differently than other descriptive
verbs. Instead of converting h into it’s converted into to make the direct modifier.

to be cold

a cold-

to be spicy

Example sentences
1 .

Hot soup is very delicious.

2 .

I like spicy food.

Don’t make the common mistake of using
tt. You must use for td irregulars.

3. xi|

My father really dislikes cold coffee.

4.

I like easy tests.

O 12-12. Special case direct modifiers

Any time the stem of a descriptive verb ends with a ^ (S| #) c h □, then the ^ is just
changed to a l\_ (M-E-). We will officially learn (to be long) in the next lesson but it’s
used here to show the pattern.

2. U Dja|°| (W##ora|fl.

I like long haired girls.

KoreanFromZero.com 214

Another special case is when the descriptive verb ends with 21 or 21 With these types
you simply add -b to the stem.

Example sentences

1. \*11 £!^°l ^oi| xHaiSl-b^yoi

There are a lot of interesting teachers at my friend’s school.

2. xi A] 21011 2121-b-^oi SSlojfl. — ' - ~~V

There was a lot of tasteless food at that restaurant over there.

Here X-j does not
mean “I” because
it’s directly in
front of a noun.

O 13-9. Command form using BASIC form

The BASIC form of any verb without 2t on the end can be very rude. With friends it’s just
casual, but be very careful to not drop the fi.. If the -2. is missing, you might be considered
rude, especially when speaking to elders.

Example sentences

1.

2 . 7 \\

3. 0|-A=l!

4. 6H ah

5. 2H

6. Aj-I

^7. gjoj ah \_

Adding the 2. makes everyone of the sentences above polite enough to use with everyday
people. NOTE: If an elder says this form to you, it is not necessarily rude, but just casual.
SUMMARY: If you want to be safe add 2..

O 13-10. Quick rules for casual Korean

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 14 - Negative tense

239

Lesson 14:

Negative tense

Before This Lesson

1. Know how to make past tense and future tense
   verbs.

Lesson Goals

1. Learn how to create the negative tense of verbs
   and then conjugate into the past and future
   tenses.

From The Teachers

1. In this lesson we learn the long awaited negative
   tense. Since there is “past negative”, “future
   negative” and, “present negative”, you will actually
   be learning three new tenses. This might seem
   overwhelming, but it isn’t if you consider you are
   simply building off of the original negative verb.

It’s VERY important to treat the \*| ^ verb as a NEW verb. If you treat it as a new verb,

then you automatically know how to make all the tenses you already know.

For example, let’s conjugate the new verb 7\J] & h F|- (to not go). ( " ^

3. 7\J\ 7j0j|fl. (future) I won’t go.

4. 7\X\ (past) I didn’t go.

It doesn’t matter if the verb is a descriptive, action, td irregular, o(-C|-, or even eL irregular
verb. The pattern to make the negative verb is always just (STEM + T| ?4F|-). Let’s look at a
negative descriptive verb conjugation.

O 14-5. Shall I? Shall we? ~(°) = ?4

The (°)s 7)\ pattern means, “Shall we” or “Shall I” depending on the context. If a verb has
a c: □, you add %~>1\ and without a c h £! you add s (E|-§-) to the stem and then add J J[.
This is a great way to make suggestions.

3S Special Information <$>

The (°.)s^|- pattern is commonly used when talking to oneself or thinking. In this case
it is better translated as “I wonder if I should...” NOTE: You don’t need fi. in your
thoughts since you don’t need to be polite to yourself.

O 14-6. Let’s ~(°) H A| L|-

The “Let’s do” form is created by adding %■[ to any stem. The more polite version is made
by adding ^M Lf- after verb stems with c 1- □, or if the stem doesn’t have a add

O 14-7. About something -Oil CH°H

Oil LHof] is a combination of the Ml particle and the verb C(|o|-[l|-. Ml M1°H means “about” or
“in regards to”. Just add this after any noun and it means “about” that noun. It’s very useful
with the new verbs we learned in the last lesson. Oil 0H°H replaces #/■§■ in the sentence.

Grammar SB

O 15-9. To and from (-x- E 1 /

The Korean version “to” and “from, until” work exactly like their English counterparts. The
only difference is that they come after the place or time. So instead of saying “from Seoul”
you say “Seoul from”. They can be used one at a time, or together.

Examples (locations)

can be translated as “as far as”, “up to” etc. The time and location marker Oil is used
with an exact destination or time. shows progression to the final time or location.

When saying “from a (place)” or “from a (time)”, both nr El and 0||Ai can be used.
Koreans however normally use OH A-| more with places and -^-Ej more with times.
To sound natural you should also use Oil A] with locations instead of -¥-Ej.

O 15-10. Please do this

In section 9-5 you learned how to ask for things using ^All-fi and in section 13-10 you
learned the casual way to make a command. Now we will learn the polite way to ask
someone to do something. The pattern is BASIC + ^A]|fi.. -§-/-§• is not required.

4. °H ^Ai|fi..

^5. gjOj^Aila,

O 15-11. S/# ^( 7 \) OICK s/# ^( 7 \) atq (Can do and can’t do)

The 4 1 portion of # 4" aa^ (can do) and # 4 1 (can’t do) means “ability” or
“possibility”. If the stem of the verb does not have a then you add s to it, and if there
is a ^ □ then you add # after it. NOTE: The ?\ is often dropped.

First let’s see how we can apply this pattern to some action verbs.

/^Example sentences

1. 2 \*11 °R0|| # ^ °|Oia?

2. Ail 0||M °;oia?

When can you come to Korea?

Can you see my pretty face?

KoreanFromZero.com 266

--(j)^S§S Special Information <£>--s

The rules for modifying the stem of verbs to create the -4 1 / ~^r verb form is

exactly the same as creating the future tense verbs. These rules are covered in section
10-4 and 10-5. Another simple way to create this pattern is:

(future tense) MINUS 7-1011 9 . PLUS ^

1. iM0||fi.

1 will do it.

S4= 9 io\a..

1 can do it.

stew.

1 can’t do it.

2. IMOIIfl.

1 will go.

1 can go.

atom.

1 can’t go.

3. ##?lO||fl.

1 will ask.

1 can ask.

1 can’t ask. y

NOTE: It’s possible to use this form with descriptive verbs, and you might even hear it
used. However, typically Koreans would say “I think it will be cold” or “it might be cold”,
instead of “it can be cold” or “it could be cold” with descriptive verbs.

O 15-12. Doing things well \*. h ~

You can add before any verb to say that it’s done well. Or if you use the negative form
how well you don’t to something. With a verb the # must be directly in front of the

□ 16-5. Ongoing present tense form ~H SIP (~ing)

The present tense is easily created just by using the BASIC form of a verb. To say "I am
doing an action right now" then you will use the ~TL 5|L(- pattern. This pattern is created by
adding~TL 2i II f directly to the stem. After adding ~TL 2i II f you can then conjugate the verb
into various tenses.

r

v

(verb stem) + H
(verb stem) ing

J

Example sentences

1. 5jTL2it>m.

1 am eating.

2.

1 was eating.

3. oi X | oio^.

1 am not eating.

4. 2i\*l SStOifi.

--Special Information <!>-

As you learn more Korean you will learn more than one way to say the same thing.

For example all of the sentences below mean basically the same thing.

1. *1P|- *1# ^ 01-2.. I am eating now.

2. *||7f- *1# ojojfl. I am eating now.

3. §0|Oj|a. I am in the middle of eating now.

Over time and with more experience you will choose which sentence best suits your
situation. One thing that can be said about ^ Oja vs Sl°1-£t is that there is no
ambiguity with ^jTL SI^-ST Depending on the context ^jOja can mean "I will eat.",

"I am eating", and even "Eat (command)." However, ^jTL SI°1-&. can only mean “I am
eating.”

□ 16-6. E|-i:|- (to ride)

The mode of transportation by which you are riding is marked with the object marker #.

Example sentences

O 16-13. ~S Plurals in Korean

# is added to nouns to make them plural. However, when it’s obvious from the context,

if is not needed. -1- is most commonly added after people but can be used after objects
also. All of the following words CAN be plural OR singular WITHOUT the #, however,
adding if makes it clear that there is more than one.

Example plurals

1.

friends

2. MW

people

3. aj#

f 0f0| means

books

4.

“child” and 0|j7|

\_\_ means “baby”

teachers

5.

children

6. S#

houses, homes

7.

cats -

Example sentences

1.

2. £!^#0| #7-j0j|S.

This can mean “a
friend” or “friends”
will come.

This can only mean
“friends” will come.

3. aj£0j|

4.

L£|#0|

3

This can only mean
“churches”.

O 16-14. Unable to do form ~\*|

In lesson 15 you learned how to say “can” and “can’t do”. Now we will learn a much
stronger form of “can’t do”. ~A| ^-o|-[if- (pronounced S.E(-L|-) means that you are unable to
do something. There is perhaps a physical barrier that prevents you from doing it.

KoreanFromZero.com 288

For example, you have no legs, therefore you are “UNABLE to walk” :£o|].2.)

If your mom doesn’t let you go to a party, then you “CAN NOT go” (s h 4 1 21^-2-), but there
isn’t a physical limitation. The pattern is very similar to the T| Qf Cf- (won’t, don’t do) form.

Korean From Zero! - Lesson 16 - Not being able to do

291

--(DllSfi Special Information <£>--

SUMMARY: Proper usage of ~T| and ~T| is important.

It’s important to understand the difference between “not doing something” and “not
being able to do something”. In English, we might say “I didn’t see you yesterday” and
no one would be offended. However, the form ~T| ^1 / 21 ~ implies “chose not to”.

So, if you say 0]\*1I MT| to a friend, you are saying “I chose not to see you

yesterday”. The better phrase is, 01\*11 MT| (| couldn’t see you yesterday”).

Examples (my choice)
i.

I didn’t work.

Examples (not my choice)

i. n

I couldn’t work.

2 .

I didn’t call.

I couldn’t call.

3. 0|OHQJ|| oh ML)|a.

-- <^)ilSpecial Information^)--

In Korea, the verb £!°|-Ef- means, “to want a~”. It is used when you want a noun. For
example, “I want money.” etc. However, this structure is not as broadly used in Korean
as it is in English. Many students of Korean assume £!o|-llf- is used like the
English “I want a~”.

This is not the case, has a much deeper meaning. It’s more like a “hoping for” or

“longing for” something. Typically when English speakers say, “I want a car”, Koreans
will say T|-g- A|-TL 4!°l-2- (I want to buy a car.) instead. You should fight the instinct to
say “I want a~” and instead use the most appropriate verb.

connect two sentences together. This is done by using a word in front of the second
sentence that gives it relation to the first one. Here are the words you need to know:

51-XI El- but, however

II ELI H and then

HIB.H AH so, therefore, that’s why

These words are normally only said BETWEEN sentences. It’s okay to have a pause if
required after the connector word.

Writing a book, especially a text book, is a daunting task. Without dedicated book reviewers
